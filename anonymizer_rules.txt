To anonymize a file containing a mix of sensitive data such as customer names, social security numbers (SSNs), account numbers, and other financial information, you'll need to implement different anonymization techniques for each type of data. Here's a step-by-step approach to handle various types of sensitive data:

Customer Name:

Anonymize by replacing customer names with generic placeholders like "Customer 1," "Customer 2," etc.
Alternatively, you can completely remove customer names if not needed for analysis.
Social Security Number (SSN):

Anonymize SSNs by replacing them with random or pseudonymous SSN-like numbers. Ensure that the generated numbers do not correspond to real SSNs.
Account Number:

Anonymize account numbers by replacing them with randomly generated or pseudonymous account numbers.
Account Type (e.g., checking, savings, loan):

Anonymize by mapping the original account types to a generic set of account types (e.g., "Account Type A," "Account Type B").
Branch Code or Location:

Anonymize branch codes or locations by mapping them to generic identifiers (e.g., "Branch 1," "Branch 2").
Transaction Date:

No need to anonymize transaction dates unless there are specific privacy concerns related to them.
Transaction Amount:

Anonymize transaction amounts by adding random noise or rounding them to protect privacy.
Transaction Type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, payment):

Anonymize transaction types by mapping them to generic transaction types (e.g., "Transaction Type A," "Transaction Type B").
Balance After Transaction:

Anonymize balance values by adding random noise or rounding them if needed.
Loan Amount (if applicable):

Anonymize loan amounts by adding random noise or rounding them if needed.
Interest Rate (for loans or savings accounts):

Anonymize interest rates by adding random noise or rounding them if needed.
Credit Score:

Anonymize credit scores by replacing them with pseudonymous values.
Investment Portfolio Details (if applicable):

Anonymize investment portfolio details by replacing them with pseudonymous data.
Contact Information (phone number, email):

Anonymize contact information by removing or replacing it with generic placeholders.
Residential Address:

Anonymize residential addresses by removing or replacing them with generic location information.
Date of Birth (DOB):

Anonymize DOBs by replacing them with pseudonymous dates or by only retaining the year of birth without specific dates.
